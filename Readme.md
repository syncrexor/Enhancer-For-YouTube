Firefox Add-on "Enhancer for YouTube" Version 2.0.121 (With Ad Blocker)



in "Manage Extensions" on Firefox, install "enhancerforyoutube@maximerf.addons.mozilla.org.xpi" by: Install Add-on From File... from Gear icon. After that, disable "Allow automatic updates" in the plugin settings section so that the plugin doesn't automatically update to the new version (latest version doesn't have Ad Blocker anymore)
